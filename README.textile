h1. Just Documents

Web site creation done just with documents (except for the users and comments...).

Just Documents provides an empty Ruby on Rails document orientated project designed to be a base for your own project.


h2. Usage

When you launch Just Documents after a fresh install, you'll notice that when you enter the website there are no pages. You'll need to create yourself a new account in the signup (/signup) and enable admin access for the user on the Rails console to be able to create one:

<pre>
User.first.update_attribute(:role, 'admin')
</pre>

When logged in, go back to the site and you should be able to see a set of buttons to create a new Document. Documents are created in a similar fashion to a Wiki, just provide the URL and you'll be given the option to create the document.

Just Documents provides a set of pre-defined "layouts" for creating your site, at the moment the root-layouts are:

* @page@ - a really simple page
* @blog@ - a blog with posts in the middle and a side bar at the right

Root-layouts are used with documents that have no parents, and usually have a set of children. The following is a list of the main children:

* @blog_entry@ - entries in a blog page.
* @side_bar_entry@ - small boxes usually show at the side of the site.


h2. Roles

Currently, the system supports three roles, normal user, 'editor', and 'admin'. A normal user can't really do anything other than the fact that their comments
will be published instantly (this might become an option in the future). An editor is allowed to create, edit, and manage documents, but they cannot delete anything.
An admin can do anything.
