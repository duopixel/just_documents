h1. Just Documents

Web site creation done just with documents (except for the users and comments...).

Just Documents provides an empty Ruby on Rails document orientated project designed to be a base for your own project.


h2. Usage

When you launch Just Documents after a fresh install, you'll notice that when you enter the website there are no pages. You'll need to create yourself a new account in the signup (/signup) and enable admin access for the user on the Rails console to be able to create one:

<pre>
User.first.update_attribute(:role, 'admin')
</pre>

When logged in, go back to the site and you should be able to see a set of buttons to create a new Document. Documents are created in a similar fashion to a Wiki, just provide the URL and you'll be given the option to create the document.

Just Documents provides a set of pre-defined "layouts" for creating your site, at the moment the root-layouts are:

* @page@ - a really simple page
* @blog@ - a blog with posts in the middle and a side bar at the right

Root-layouts are used with documents that have no parents, and usually have a set of children. The following is a list of the main children:

* @blog_entry@ - entries in a blog page.
* @side_bar_entry@ - small boxes usually show at the side of the site.
